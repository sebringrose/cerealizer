# Super Cereal ðŸ¥£

Serialize and deserialize any object without any weird syntax.

**TL;DR:** You get to keep your lovely graph structure (even if its circular ðŸ¤¯) and all of your lovely class methods too.

## But how?

```
import { Store, Model } from "./mod.ts";

const store = new Store();

class Person extends Model {
  name: string;
  friends: Person[] = [];

  constructor(name: string) {
    super(store, arguments);
    this.name = name;
  }

  addFriend(friend: Person) {
    this.friends.push(friend);
    friend.friends.push(this);
  }
}

const jim = new Person("Jim");
const bob = new Person("Bob");
jim.addFriend(bob);

const bobId = bob.save();
const freshBob = store.load(bobId) as Person;

const steve = new Person("Steve");
freshBob.addFriend(steve);

console.log(freshBob.friends);
```

The Al-Gore-ithm does a depth-first-search, leaving unique IDs on non-primitive values. It then serializes and stores objects by ID, replacing all refs with the corresponding ID to "unlink" the structure so it never gets stuck in a circular reference loop.

First instantiate a `Store`, then make your classes extend `Model` and call `super(store, arguments)` in their constuctors. This allows the store to hold onto constructor clones that reinstantiate the classes before using `Object.assign` to apply deserialized values.

## But why?

I wanted a tool to serialize my data and store it. No matter how complex the structure or whether in the browser on the server. 

The goal was to require minimal additional code beyond regular looking JS/TS and I think this fits the bill nicely, just extend from `Model` and call `super(store, arguments)` in constructor. The only caveat is that you have use `store.load(id) as Class` to keep accurate TS syntax highlighting (there is currently no way for TS to infer this and generic types don't work with recursion).
